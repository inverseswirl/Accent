        It is proven that success both personally and professionally is about effective communication skills. Such skills are highly prized in creative, knowledge-based workforces. As technology shifts the working landscape, and teams become increasingly diverse, good communication in all its forms becomes more than a nice to have. Bloombergâ€™s Annual Skills Report regularly places Communication as the number one skill actively considered by recruiting firms.
