        It is proven that success both personally and professionally is about
        effective communication skills. Such skills are highly prized in
        creative, knowledge-based workforces. As technology shifts the working
        landscape, and teams become increasingly diverse, good communication in
        all its forms becomes more than a nice to have. Bloombergâ€™s Annual
        Skills Report regularly places Communication as the number one skill
        actively considered by recruiting firms.
